# opengl-tile-matching-game

This is a project I have implemented for the course Introduction to Computer Graphics at METU. It uses OpenGL and GLM libraries. \
From the project directory bunny_crush, run the following commands to start the game:
> make hw3 \
> ./hw3 <grid_width> <grid_height> <object_file>

You can view the demo video [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/cUyQWt2lxoA).

### TO-DO
- Make objects pop after matching
